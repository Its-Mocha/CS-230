  1.) The client was the for the gaming room, they where looking for a way to have many game on a server for their clients that use the service.   
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  
  2.) I developed the documentation with security in mind and fast access.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  3.) I found the design process of the code helpful with fist writing what the client wanted then coding it.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  4.) I think if I had more time I would redo the whole thing, I think it can all be impoved.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 5.) Over the weeks making this program ive had to anilize what was being asked. Its important to make sure you know that the user is looking for in the end product.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
 6.) Defently prof reading what the client is looking for before coding the program.
